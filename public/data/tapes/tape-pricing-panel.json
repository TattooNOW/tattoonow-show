    "topic": "Is Hourly Pricing Dead? The Great Tattoo Pricing Debate",
    "topicDescription": "Three artists with very different pricing models debate the best approach. Hourly vs flat rate vs project-based. Who's right?",

    "talkingPoints": [
      "What's your current pricing model and why?",
      "When did you switch from hourly to your current model?",
      "How do clients react to your pricing — any pushback?",
      "What's the biggest mistake you see other artists make with pricing?",
      "If a new artist asked you how to price their first year, what would you say?",
      "Lightning round: name your price for these 3 hypothetical pieces"
    ],

    "presenterNotes": "Host moderates — don't let one voice dominate. After each question, go around the table: panelist 1 answers, then 2, then 3. Encourage friendly disagreement. The 'lightning round' at the end is the most shareable moment — keep it fast and fun. Display each panelist's headshot with lower-third when they're speaking."
